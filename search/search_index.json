This can prime the reader for the next section and might also help to break up an otherwise monotonous wall of text. Notes MOTIVATION - knowledge is power - asking the right questions - solving the right problems CONCEPTS - problem definition - explore similar problems - anticipate results (form a hypothesis) TOOLS - make a list - ask a friend - socratic questioning - design rationale Overview As you start to explore a system it's likely that you'll have some questions. As you learn some questions will be answered, but some will not. This might highlight parts of the system that could improve. If so, then the next step is to figure out what the problem is and how to solve it . It's important to spend a lot of time on this because solving problems starts with asking questions . You can't solve something you don't understand. The most important thing is to have a clear and concise definition of the problem you're trying to solve . It should be obvious. If you're unclear about what you're doing and why everything else is more difficult. Once you have a clear problem definition you can explore similar problems. This might provide intuition around how other problems were solved and the results of implementing various solutions. This can then help you form a hypothesis of what is likely to help solve your problem. There are several tools and techniques that can help you define your problem and identify likely solutions. The first is to just write it down. Try to define the problem in a single sentence and make a list of things of similar problems and their solutions. Then ask a friend and see what they have to say. Apply Socratic questioning to further explore the problem and your thinking around it. Then once you have a few good ideas produce a design rationale explaining your thought process, the ideas considered, and why you think a particular solution might work well. Then you have a clear problem definition and solution hypothesis. Concepts Problem Definition Defining the question you want to ask or the problem you want to solve is one of the most important steps. If you don't know what problem you're solving how will you know when you've found a solution? Also, if people don't know what problem you're trying to solve they won't be able to work with you and help you find solutions. Can you state the problem in a single sentence? How will you know when the problem is solved? What are the constraints for any potential solutions? Explore Similar Problems History doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme. It's likely that someone somewhere has had to deal with a similar problem as the one you're exploring. It might be that the dynamics of the problem are similar, but it's applied in a different context. It might also be that the context is similar, but there was a slightly different problem. Regardless, building off of prior work can often save you a lot of time and energy. Can you find any problems similar to the one you're trying to solve? If so, could a solution to that problem be applied to your problem (potentially with modifications)? Hypothesis The point of running experiments is to validate results. There's an infinite amount of things we could do, but forming a hypothesis allows us to test things that seem the most probable . The hypothesis has to come before the experiment, otherwise you haven't proven anything other than your ability to cherry pick data and/or get lucky. By formulating a detailed hypothesis you'll have a better idea of what's working or what's not, and more importantly why not. What do you expect to happen if you do nothing? What do you expect to happen if you implement a solution? Tools Make a list Just writing out your ideas can help you start to understand and organize them better. You can even plot ideas on a spreadsheet and then rank them according to their attributes and trade-offs. The exercise of defining attributes can often help you better understand the problem and potential solutions, even if there isn't a clear solution yet. In the initial stages (after brainstorming) a simple way to triage ideas is to first eliminate ideas as rationally as possible based on their characteristics. Then, once you've curated via logic use emotions to choose between the best options left. This way you eliminate choices that you might be biased towards, but can also move forward to choose a solution if there's no obvious way to discern between options. Ask a friend Getting feedback, esp from people with different viewpoints than your own, can help you better understand the problem you're trying to solve as well as where there might be gaps in your own thinking. Socratic Questioning Socratic Questioning is a process of evaluation that can help you explore alternative perspectives to understand a problem. This looks something like: Explaining your thought process to clarify your thinking. Look for (and challenging) assumptions in your problem definition or solution. Providing evidence to validate those assumptions. Asking what you might think if you were arguing against the idea. Explore the first and second order effects of the solution, and new problems that might arise as a result. Question the original question to determine if it's even the right problem to be solving to create the change you want. Design Rationale A design rationale explains the decisions made during a design process, and the reasons why those decisions were made. Its primary goal is to support designers by providing a means to record and communicate the argumentation and reasoning behind the design process. This often involves the questions you asked, the solutions considered, and why your proposed solution seems like the best choice. the reasons behind a design decision the justification for it the other alternatives considered the trade offs evaluated, an the argumentation that led to the decision","title":"Ask"},{"location":"ask/#ask","text":"Picture of the Ask section (with pictures and colors) goes here.

Notes MOTIVATION - critical thinking and speaking - intersubjectivity > objective social goals - financial economies -> trade assets - political economies -> debate ideas CONCEPTS - look for data - informed opinion - goodwill - fallacies - sacred vs profane - the power of defaults - global vs local - campaigning TOOLS - social media - socratic questioning - clarify assumptions - eat a snack Overview Any idea can seem good in our heads. We don't really get to test them out and improve them until we bring them into the real world. The first step in this process is debate . Sharing ideas and defending and/or updating them based on feedback. Good debates involve critical thinking . This means that people will be critical. This is OK, good even, as long as we're critical on ideas and not people. This way we can improve our ideas and arrive at better outcomes for all parties involved. Politics is how we adjudicate ideas and preferences between stakeholders. A healthy political process allows people to battle over ideas. An unhealthy political process is when ideas are used to battle people. The former leads to productivity, while the later leads to corruption. If you find yourself looking for data or ideas to battle people, take a step back. Computer aided governance requires a data driven decision making process . If your emotions are in the drivers seat you're not doing it right. Why does this matter? Why not just avoid politics and focus on code? Many social systems aim to represent the interests of a group of people as a whole, but they are not independent entities. They cannot think or act on their own. Political actors, however, can. The system is a process, not a conscious entity. Opinions are the domain of political actors. It is then their responsibility represent their interests by engaging in the political process to take action. The constitutional rules of a system determine how political actors can represent their interests and adjudicate disagreements within that system. When individuals can take political action they have many different opinions, interests, and incentives. There is no single voice that represents them all. There are, however, many smaller groups within the system who have more concentrated opinions and incentives. These minority groups are often impacted by, and thus care a lot about, a few specific things. The majority is less impacted by those things, and rationally , they choose to remain less informed of them. The cost of becoming informed outweighs potential benefits. There's only so much time in the day. For concentrated minority groups, however, the benefits of becoming informed, coordinating, and acting to represent their interests is very high. Naturally, these minority groups are the most politically active. So while many social systems aim to represent the interests of the majority of individuals, but most individuals don't care about most things. Those who do care are often concentrated minorities who care about specific things. They are the most likely to engage in the political process to have their opinions represented. The system then represents the interests of coordinated minority groups rather than the majority of individuals as a whole. This is not an easy problem to solve. One thing that might help is if everyone has skin in the game and participates in governance. Otherwise minority groups will push a system to a local optima that favors them and no one will push back. Someone has to actually care about the opposite side of a policy otherwise power is just balanced in theory. This is why you have to understand and engage in politics. While debate might be contentious, it helps improve the ideas and decisions that guide a system. Concepts Look For Data Is the motivation and rationale for a proposal backed by data? If not, can you find any data that supports or refutes a proposal? Goodwill In the early days there's often a lot of goodwill among a community/project. This is great, but it doesn't scale. Thinking that just because everyone agrees now means you can avoid engaging in governance is incorrect. It's important to practice engaging in debate and data driven decision making when things are easy. That way when they're hard you have practice and a process to fall back on. This won't eliminate conflict, but it can help preserve goodwill as the system grows. Informed Opinions According to Charlie Munger, having an informed opinion requires being able to internalize questions enough to be able to argue for and against competing viewpoints. This can help greatly speed up debates by reducing time wasted on obvious answers. It can also make things more productive as the ideas that are surfaced are likely to be more interesting and insightful if some real thought is put into them. Confirmation bias Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values. People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes. The effect is strongest for desired outcomes, for emotionally charged issues, and for deeply entrenched beliefs. Confirmation bias cannot be eliminated entirely, but it can be managed, for example, by education and training in critical thinking skills. If we all agreed on everything all the time collective decision making processes would not be needed. When we disagree, but want to come to consensus to collectively move forward together, then we need governance. The problem is that the more we care about a decision the more we have desired outcomes, emotionally charged issues, and deeply entrenched beliefs. So when we're drafting or analyzing governance proposals we're likely to be exhibiting confirmation bias, which defeats the purpose of data driven communication and debate to begin with. This is incredibly hard to mitigate, but being aware of it is the first step. The power of defaults Defaults have gravity. It takes a certain amount of energy to break out of the current local optima and into a new state. Be aware of this if you're proposing any type of change. The bigger the change, the more political capital is required to move the system in that direction. Don't Take Things Personally. Or at least try not to. This is easier said than done. Once you've mastered this you've mastered life. Be hard on ideas, easy on people. Sacred vs Profane Sacred governance is like sacred cows . Cool in theory. Less cool IRL. Understanding the theory of governance is good (sacred), but in reality the process is going to be messy (profane). The theory can inform how we think about governance and help us navigate the process, but theory is not governance itself. The map is not the territory. The theory is not the practice. Both theory and practice are useful, but as compliments. Don't get too tied to one or the other. Formal and informal fallacies Many arguments are formally valid, but informally fallacious . This is hard to detect, but incredibly important. Critical thinking can help identify formal fallacies, and questioning the assumptions that a proposal is dependent on can help identify informal fallacies. Campaigning Code programs machines. Media programs humans. Campaigning to get people engaged is a non-trivial part of the political process. Those who do this successfully tend to win. Framing The way a problem is framed affects which questions are asked and what one looks for in conducting empirical inquiries. If you restate the problem in your own words, or with different assumptions, does that change how you think about it? Global vs Local Governance is globally positive-sum, but locally zero-sum. At the global level governance is positive-sum. It allows us to: achieve more than we could individually and/or avoid ruinous outcomes (coordination) adapt over time so that processes and decisions remain relevant and the system as a whole can improve (anti-fragility and evolution) At the local level governance is zero-sum. It allows us to: represent our interests and compete for power through the political process (competitive markets) adjudicate competing interests between competing actors so that consensus can be reached even if actors disagree (consensus) If you believe that competition in financial markets improves the products available, then it might also follow that competition in political markets might also improve the proposals presented. By engaging in the political process and applying critical thinking to proposals you're improving the political economy of the system. Tools Use Socratic questioning to check your assumptions. Socratic Questioning can help you get a fresh perspective when you're getting too emotional or are just stuck in a rut. Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?) Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?) Looking for evidence (How can I back this up? What are the sources?) Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?) Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?) Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?) Clarify assumptions People confuse facts with opinions, cultural norms with laws, assumptions with agreements. This is a large part of all conflicts. The other main thing is incentives. If people present opinions, ask them to back them up with facts. Ask why they think that, how they came to that conclusion, and what evidence they're building their hypothosis on. Either you'll learn something or they will. Engage in good faith and give people the benefit of the doubt. What would your response be if you thought they were the smartest person in the world? What would your response be if you they were your best friend? Are either of these responses potentially better than your current thinking? This list is a good start to think about how to engage in good faith. Make sure you're not hangry. Really simple. Eat a snack. Take a nap. Try again in a few hours.

Notes MOTIVATION - fortune favors the bold CONCEPTS - legitimacy - politics TOOLS - it depends Overview Decisions! Actions are required to create change. Once an idea has been debated and refined it needs to be enacted. Regardless of the governance process of a system, decision making is going to be political. That's OK. Just remember to be hard on the ideas and easy on the people. Throughout history those who attack people are generally less well regarded than those who attack problems and change systems. How decisions are made in any specific system is going to be unique. It's very important that you understand this context so that you can engage productively. This last part is important because without it nothing happens. Concepts Legitimacy Legitimacy means many things to many people. In short, it's the acknowledgement and acceptances of a power structure, and thus the acceptance of the results of the power structure. Agree on process, even if you disagree on outcomes. Legitimacy requires explicit and implicit acceptance of a system. If people don't really have much of an option they'll go along with something, but then not participate or rebel half way through. Politics As mentioned before, politics is how we make decisions in groups to distribute resources and status. While many people hate politics, as long as people are involved it's inevitable. People are going to want to advocate for their interests when valuable resources are on the line. If you have a formal political process it'll be easy to see that. If the political process is informal that doesn't mean it's not there. It just means that it's harder to see. A political process can be healthy or unhealthy. A healthy version might look like stakeholders advocate for their interests, present evidence, engage in intelligent debate, and vote with balanced power to determine the best outcome for all parties involved. An unhealthy political process might involve stakeholders advocating for their interests and ignoring everyone else, slandering rather than engaging with facts, yelling over everyone so that no one can talk, and imbalanced power dynamics that disenfranchise stakeholders. Both are political processes, but one can be productive and the other is a nightmare. Regardless, politics is unavoidable if you're going to make decisions in a group to distribute resources. It's important to understand how politics works in general, and then how politics (group decision making over resources) works within the context of the system you're engaging with. Then you can have a better idea of what you're getting into and how to engage productively. Tools The process to enact proposals is dependent on the governance process of each system and therefore outside the scope of this article. That being said, it is a very important step! If you have a convoluted governance process or voting weight is not well distributed among stakeholders then success is unlikely.

Notes MOTIVATION - thought experiment with code - interactive doc CONCEPTS - legibility - assumptions - specificity - A/B testing - ergodicity - reflexivity TOOLS - MatLab - cadCAD - Labs - tokenSPICE Overview Models allow you to define your ideas and test them in hypothetical environments. They're like thought experiments , but with code. Something in between a white paper and a working implementation. This is great if you want to test an idea before building it, or want to test variations on an idea to see which might be the best. When creating a model the point is to help you explore an idea, but also to help others do the same. As such it needs to be legible. The assumptions the model depends on as well as the things the model is specifically exploring should be made explicit. This way it's easier to A/B test the model assumptions and parameters. There are many tools to create models. MatLab is popular, but expensive. cadCAD is newer, but open source. There's also stand alone frameworks like tokenSPICE that begin to incorporate EVM testnets into modeling and cadCAD services like BlockScience Labs that make it easier to automatically run models based on real world data. What's best for you will be dependent on the context in which you're operating. Regardless of what tools you choose, the model should be easy to read and run. That way people can engage with and contribute to your work. This is one of the benefits of open source software in that anyone will be able to run it. Concepts Legibility A model is a living document. It conveys information, but you can also modify and interact with it to learn new information. The results of running a model are only a small part of it's value. Most of the value comes from people's ability to explore and modify the parameters and assumptions within the model to better understand something. This requires your model to be legible. Check out the [insert python/cadCAD code syntax and best practices guide here] to see some examples. Is your model structured so that it's easy to interact with? Could people easily modify it to test your assumptions and their own? Assumptions Models make assumptions about the world in order to focus on the thing that is being modeled. The model is a representation of a thing, not the thing itself. Just like with a map, it's important to specify what you included, what you left out, and why. It's also important to specify what you're assuming to be true and/or external states/environments that you assume the model is operating within. What does your model assume or require to be true? Are these assumptions stated explicitly? Ergodicity Visit all parts of the space that the system moves in, in a uniform and random sense. A sufficiently large collection of random samples from a process can represent the average statistical properties of the entire process. Then you understand the full range of the state space and what states are more likely with what parameters. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodicity Specificity Specificity is opposite of assumptions. It's what the model is exploring in detail. What question is the model exploring? What did you choose to be specific about in relation to this question? Is your model specific enough that it defines the problem and the potential solution? A/B Testing A/B testing allows you to test multiple variations of a thing. This is very important if you see how a proposed solution might behave under a wide range of assumptions. Be aware that A then B is not the same as testing A and B simultaneously. Statefulness and ordering is important. The later compares A and B against the same data and this is what we're talking about when we say A/B testing. Test the same idea under multiple contexts. Test multiple ideas within the same context. Data generation Models also allow you to generate new data. This can be useful if you want to test alternate scenarios and explore the state space more than what would be possible with historical data. If your assumptions are made explicit then you can also test your model in different contexts. That way you can have a better idea of under what macro conditions your assumptions might hold. Reflexivity Reflexivity happens when multiple variables within the model feed into each other. This can create exponential amplification or suppression of metrics. This throws off wild data that makes it difficult to gain any understanding from the model. If there's any reflexivity involved make sure it's there for a very good reason and you understand exactly how it works. Are there any portions of your model that are self referential or that refer to each other in a loop?

Notes MOTIVATION - feedback CONCEPTS - success - failure TOOLS - automated alerts - recurring runs - manual review Overview Science wouldn't work if we ran experiments but didn't bother to record the results. Same goes for governance. There needs to be a feedback loop between decisions and results. Monitoring allows you to verify the results of decisions to see if they had their intended effects. If a proposal succeeds you'll want to see if it actually has the effect you intended. If so, then great. If not, then you're back to the ask stage to understand why it's not having the effect you intended. If a proposal doesn't succeed that's OK too. If you have a hypothesis of what will happen if the problem is not solved then you can validate that as well. This can provide more data to support your original proposal, potentially allowing you to resubmit a modified version with more evidence to back it up. There are a few tools that can help with this process. You'll want to automate some things like alters and recurring model runs, but others will be more manual like engaging with the community to understand sentiment. Both are important to provide context for your next questions and proposals. Concepts Success If the proposal passes monitor the relevant metrics to ensure it behaves as expected. If not, suggest ways to adjust accordingly. Iteration If the proposal does not pass still monitor the relevant metrics to see if your prediction holds (then you can say \"I told you so\" and/or give your proposal another go if it's still relevant). Tools Automated Alerts If possible setup automated alerts for activity that matters in the context of a proposal. This way you can know if expected milestones/thresholds/etc were reached and/or what performance looks like. Recurring Runs If you can get a raw data-feed from the system, you might be able to pipe that into your model and setup recurring runs.

Notes MOTIVATION - maps are useful - more information better decisions CONCEPTS - facts vs opinions - stakeholder analysis - resource management - governance processes TOOLS - white paper - docs - source code - activity - maps and models - research reports - community chats Overview If you want to go on an adventure the first step is often to get a map . Then once you know where you are you can navigate to your destination. This also applies to computer aided governance. If you want a system to achieve a goal, first you need to understand how it works. Then you'll know what to change to create the changes you want to see. Systems with governance imply that there is something being governed. This allows us to leverage socioeconomics to understand the people in a system, the resources they're sharing, and how they make decisions to manage those resources. As you explore you'll find a lot of information. Some will be true, and some will be truthy . Knowing the difference is key. From there you can understand the incentives and opinions of stakeholders, the tangible and intangible resources they care about, and how decisions get made. If it seems like incentives are aligned, there's a common ground of knowledge , and power structures are transparent - then you might want to engage in computer aided governance. If not, however, then be warned: there be dragons . Everyone has their own incentives and opinions. You're going to need multiple perspectives and sources to determine what is relevant to you. Some common examples are a white paper, documentation, source code, maps/models, research reports, system activity, and community chats. Each of these sources has a perspective on the system, but only by combining multiple perspectives can you start to understand what's really going on. When in doubt go to the source of the data and build up your thinking from first principles . Concepts Facts vs Opinions Socio-economic systems, being made up of both people and resources, have both subjective and objective elements to them. Both are valuable, but they're very different. Facts are true regardless of whether or not you believe in them, but opinions are only relevant as long as people believe in them. This sounds simple, but it's not. People will often state opinions with such confidence and conviction that they feel like facts. People will also question facts to better understand them within context, which can make them feel opinionated. This can create cognitive dissonance. While the dichotomy between logic and emotion is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, knowing the difference between facts and opinions can help establish common ground. If you're arguing about which direction to go, it helps to at least be looking at the same map. Stakeholder Analysis A stakeholder is an individual, group, or organization, who may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project. This often focuses on financial stakeholders who directly impact or interact with an organization in an economic way, but it doesn't have to. Stakeholder analysis is a process to understand who impacts decision making in a system as well as who would be affected by a decision. In other words, who holds a stake in the outcome? Whenever performing stakeholder analysis it's important to think about who can influence decision making, but also what might be their incentives to do so. While many stakeholders can advocate for their interests, there's often a primary group of stakeholders that determine the outcome of decisions. These primary decision makers often have additional incentives beyond those of secondary stakeholders. If incentives are aligned that's great. If not, however, this can create problems. Misaligned incentives are like dry tinder for conflict and deception. Without shared incentives moral hazard might incentivize decision makers might take on more risk than they would otherwise because they don't bear the full costs of that risk. This could lead to decisions that disproportionately benefit a few if they succeed, but leave the majority of stakeholders holding the bag if they fail. This becomes more complex in political systems. Often politicians claim to act on behalf of the greater good, but don't have incentives to do so. This leads to principle agent problems where politicians tell simple emotional stories to get votes, but then enact complicated legal policies that favor special interests (such as bailing out risk taking institutions). This is especially complex when small/large game dynamics come into play and incentives might be aligned within a system, but external influences override those incentives. Aligned incentives can create a foundation for cooperation. It doesn't guarantee cooperation, but it makes it possible. A simple way to do think about this is to ask if all stakeholders have skin in the game and incentives are shared between primary and secondary stakeholders. Another is to think about feedback loops and if the consequences of a decision will occur soon enough to impact the decision makers. If these things are true then there is a higher likelihood that decisions will be made in a way that aims to maximize stakeholder value. The key word here is aims. Even if incentives are aligned and people have the best of intentions sometimes things do not work or cause unintended side effects. Governance is hard. While exploring the incentive dynamics of political economies in more detail is beyond the scope of this guide, it's highly recommended. If incentives are aligned cooperation is possible, but if incentives are misaligned conflict is inevitable. There's an infinite number of ways that incentives can be misaligned, but only a few ways that they can be aligned. Creating organized and resilient low-entropy systems that don't devolve into chaos is difficult, but it's possible. A few questions you might ask yourself to start to think about stakeholder dynamics are: Who can make decisions? Who can affect decision making? What are their incentives to do so? Who is affected by those decisions? What are the incentives of various stakeholders? Are incentives misaligned, vague, or aligned? If incentives are not aligned, where might there be conflict? Have there been any conflicts between stakeholders in the past that might recur in the future? Resource Management Here resources refer to the thing that is being governed. There are many types of resources. Some are tangible and some are intangible. Some are renewable and some non-renewable. Many of these resources are formally accounted for, but some are not. The type of resource being governed will inform the governance process. For example, hierarchical corporate governance works great for stocks, but less so for public goods. Democratic governance might be good for shared public infrastructure, but less ideal for an early stage startup that needs to move fast and decisively. One size does not fit all. The type of resources being managed will impact the efficacy of the process used to govern those resources. What governance structures are best to manage various resources is beyond the scope of this guide. The main point here is that just because a governance process works in one context does not mean that it will automatically work in others. A few questions you might ask yourself to start to think about the resources being managed: What are the tangible resources that are being created and/or managed by the system? Are there intangible resources that are also in play, and if so, how do those relate to the tangible resources? Are these resources renewable or non-renewable? Are all of the resources being managed taken into account by the governance system? Are there resources that are not formally considered in the governance process, but still impact the process (this often involves cultural norms, knowledge, etc..)? Governance Process Governance is an important and vague word. It can mean a lot of things to a lot of people in an lot of contexts. Here when we say \"governance\" we're referring to the process of making decisions. This includes the constitutional rules that constrain the power and actions available to various actors within a system as well as the political process that actors can engage in to change rules. A few questions you might ask yourself to build intuition around how governance within the context of a complex socio-economic system: Is the governance process explicit (set rules and procedures) or implicit (rough consensus)? What is the process for stakeholders to advocate for their interests and collectively make decisions (aka what is the political process)? What is the process to make changes to the way changes are made (aka can you change constitutional rules)? Is there a history of stakeholders engaging in the political process to change rules or to change how rules are changed? What is the average speed at which changes happen? Ex: does something take a week or a year to discuss and put to a vote? Is the system governed by rules or rulers ? Tools White Paper A white paper is a report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body's philosophy on the matter. It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision. This will often explain the motivation, goals, and general design of a system. Be aware that the white paper is not the system itself. It's a sketch of the system. To understand how the system works in practice you need to read the documentation and/or source code for a specific implementation. Docs Documentation is any communicable material that is used to describe, explain or instruct regarding some attributes of an object, system or procedure, such as its parts, assembly, installation, maintenance and use. This will be much more specific than the white paper. It should provide the information you need to use, contribute to, or integrate with a system. Often documentation is incomplete or outdated. This is often due to the bandwidth constraints of the development team. That being said, software that is easy to understand and contribute to is likely to have less bugs. It's also more likely that stakeholders will be able to engage in governance productively if they understand how the system works. Documentation can help with both. Source Code The source code is the actual code that implements a system/protocol. There are various definitions of open-source and/or free software. Paraphrasing from the GNU Foundation definition of free software , it is: free to use free to inspect free to modify free to distribute Even if you can't read the code yourself, you can at least check that the software implementation of a system is free and open-source. This does not guarantee that it is bug free, but it does increase the probability that users who can read the code will find bugs sooner than later. This also puts more power in the hands of users. Anyone can fork the software if they disagree with a change, somewhat reducing the likelihood of contentious changes happening in the first place. Maps and models Complex systems will often use maps and models to communicate how they work. A map or model is not the system itself, but a representation of the system. They choose to exclude some information to focus on others. This way you don't have to understand every detail to understand the key points of how the system works. Many maps and models are interactive so that you can explore the system in more depth than a static document. Activity Digital systems do things, and the things the do are often measured. If so, then having access to system activity can help you understand what the system is doing and if it's doing it well. For blockchain based token systems the data is on-chain and cryptographically verifiable. For server based digital systems the there may be a data you can plug into or the company running a service might publish statistics, but you have to trust the source of the data as it often has no cryptographic verifiability. Independent research reports Looking at primary sources is often recommended as the first step to understanding a system. That being said, the information produced by a team building or maintaining a system might be biased (even if they're doing their best to be objective). Independent analysis is likely to also be biased, but potentially in a different way. Multiple perspectives will give you more data to help you form your own opinions about a system. Community Chat/Forum Beyond looking at technical specifications or external research, you can sometimes engage with system users directly. Many open source software projects have community chats or forums where people can ask questions and share information. Be aware that accounts on forums are often not verified to see if they actually use the product/project. In addition, the team building/maintaining a product/project might also moderate content or censor information available on official community channels. Community feedback and information can be helpful to build intuition, but, as always, take everything you read with a grain of salt.","title":"Observe"},{"location":"observe/#observe","text":"Picture of the Observe section (with pictures and colors) goes here.

Then once you know where you are you can navigate to your destination. This also applies to computer aided governance. If you want a system to achieve a goal, first you need to understand how it works. Then you'll know what to change to create the changes you want to see. Systems with governance imply that there is something being governed. This allows us to leverage socioeconomics to understand the people in a system, the resources they're sharing, and how they make decisions to manage those resources. As you explore you'll find a lot of information. Some will be true, and some will be truthy . Knowing the difference is key. From there you can understand the incentives and opinions of stakeholders, the tangible and intangible resources they care about, and how decisions get made. If it seems like incentives are aligned, there's a common ground of knowledge , and power structures are transparent - then you might want to engage in computer aided governance. If not, however, then be warned: there be dragons . Everyone has their own incentives and opinions. You're going to need multiple perspectives and sources to determine what is relevant to you. Some common examples are a white paper, documentation, source code, maps/models, research reports, system activity, and community chats.

It should also grab the reader and make them curious so that they read more. Start with why. Explain your motivation and the direction of your thinking. Include pictures and lists. It's likely that people will read the title, then skim the piece to see if it's worth reading. Pictures and lists stand out. Share diagrams and models for people to fork and explore. Conclude by restating your purpose, summarizing your proposal, and asking the reader to take action (even if that's just asking people to provide feedback). Make it easy for people to share, comment on, and engage with your proposal. Welcome and encourage feedback, and then engage with that feedback to answer questions and explore ideas. Any proposal should at least cover: - a description of a problem - a rationale for why a solution is needed - a way to verify the problem and rationale behind the solution Tools Markdown Guide Getting good at Markdown can help if you're communicating on forums that are Markdown based like Discourse .
