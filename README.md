# CAG MAP

> computer aided governance map and process

The goal of the CAG MAP repo is to turn [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/FphHh83iRxyrLPy894E1Tw) into an [MKdocs workbook](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

The benifit of MKdocs is that it's fast, free, and fully open source. It's easy to iterate on and contribute to while we define the content. Then if we want to turn the workbook into something fancy like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) or a website we can, but MKdocs can also be served directly via [GitHub pages](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/#github-pages).

We'll work on the actual CAG Map (pretty picture) in [Miro](https://miro.com/) because that seems to be what everyone likes using. Shared Miro file TBD.
