## Overview

If a tree falls in a forest with no one around does it make a sound? If you run an experiment but don't share your results does it matter? Sharing is caring. The more clearly and concisely you can share your work the more people can understand and benefit from it. In the context of governance proposals this is essential. If people don't understand what you're talking about they won't be able to engage productively or intelligently, which is going to lead to frustration and lower chances of your proposal passing.

## Concepts

### Know Your Audience

- Who is the intended audience?
- What are their incentives and why should they care about your proposal?
- What is there level of technical sophistication? Are there any concepts or prerequisites you need to explain?

### Show Your Work

- Is prior knowledge required to understand the content? If so, where can people find this knowledge to better understand your content?
- How did you arrive at your current form of thinking. Sharing the options considered in the Ask phase can help people better understand your perspective.

### Keep it simple:

- Keep your proposal as short as possible, but no simpler
- Explain things as simply as possible, but no simpler
- Pick a good title
- Start with why
- Include pictures and lists
- Share diagrams and models for people to fork and explore
- Conclude with a call to action (even if that's just asking people to provide feedback)
- Make it easy for people to share, comment on, and engage with your proposal (see next section)
