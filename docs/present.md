## Overview

Both [political feasibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_feasibility_analysis) and [incentive compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive_compatibility) matter in socio-economic systems. Data is only half the battle. What takes priority will not just depend on who can best define the goal ([strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy)) and the steps to get there ([tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactic_(method))), but also who can best communicate it and align the relevant [powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)) around it. In the context of computer *aided* governance this is essential. If people don't understand what you're talking about they won't be able to productively or intelligently engage with your work. Less engagement leads to lower chances of your proposal passing. Making your purpose, process, and hypothesis clear is the first step towards success.

Then you need to share your work. This implies that there is an audience. [Knowing your audience](https://seths.blog/2017/07/in-search-of-the-minimum-viable-audience/) can help you craft your message in a way that's accessible. The key is to make content that is both interesting and informational. People need to care. Keeping things simple, structuring your content, and showing your work is a good first step.

There's many tools that can help you improve your writing. Some are focused on mechanics and some are more for overall structure. Both are good. Start with checking your spelling, [grammar](https://www.grammarly.com/), and [run-on sentences](https://hemingwayapp.com/). From there it helps a lot to read good writing. Good writing is subjective so this is going to be dependent on your personal preferences, and more importantly, your audience.

## Concepts

### Know Your Audience

- Who is the intended audience?
- What are their incentives and why should they care about your proposal?
- What is there level of technical sophistication? Are there any concepts or prerequisites you need to explain?
- Are you passively posting your proposal and hoping your audience will come to you, or are you actively reaching out to your audience to get them engaged with your ideas?

### Show Your Work

- Is prior knowledge required to understand the content? If so, where can people find this knowledge to better understand your content?
- How did you arrive at your current form of thinking. Sharing the options considered in the Ask phase can help people better understand your perspective.

### Keep It Simple

- [Get rid of extra words](https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/08/22/the-day-you-became-a-better-writer-2nd-look/)
- [Stay focused on a clear and unambiguous purpose](https://github.com/mnielsen/notes-on-writing/blob/master/notes_on_writing.md)

### Structure

- Keep your proposal as short as possible, but no simpler.
- Explain things as simply as possible, but no simpler.
- Pick a good title. It should be the simplest possible explanation of the purpose of your writing. It should also grab the reader and make them curious so that they read more.
- Start with why. Explain your motivation and the direction of your thinking.
- Include pictures and lists. It's likely that people will read the title, then skim the piece to see if it's worth reading. Pictures and lists stand out. 
- Share diagrams and models for people to fork and explore.
- Conclude by restating your purpose, summarizing your proposal, and asking the reader to take action (even if that's just asking people to provide feedback).
- Make it easy for people to share, comment on, and engage with your proposal. Welcome and encourage feedback, and then engage with that feedback to answer questions and explore ideas.

Any proposal should at least cover:
- a description of a problem 
- a rationale for why a solution is needed
- a way to verify the problem and rationale behind the solution

## Tools

### Markdown Guide

Getting good at [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) can help if you're communicating on forums that are Markdown based like [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/).

### Hemmingway

The [Hemingway app](https://hemingwayapp.com/) can help you check for long run on sentences that go on and on, esp those that could be split into multiple sentences, which is very useful in making your ideas easier for other to understand.

### Grammerly

[Grammerly](https://www.grammarly.com/) can help you improve your grammar, but beware of installing it on a computer or browser that you use to handle sensitive information as it's probably logging everything you type and sending it to a server.
