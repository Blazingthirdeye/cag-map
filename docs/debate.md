> Picture of the Debate section (with pictures and colors) goes here. This can prime the reader for the next section and might also help to break up an otherwise monotonous wall of text.

## Overview

Any idea can seem good in our heads. We don't really get to test them out and improve them until we bring them into the real world. The first step in this process is debate. Sharing ideas and defending and/or updating them based on feedback and critique.

Good debates involve critical thinking. This means that people will be critical. This is OK, good even, as long as we're critical on ideas and not people. This way we can improve our ideas and arrive at better outcomes for all parties involved.

Politics is how we adjudicate ideas and preferences between stakeholders. A healthy political process allows people to battle over ideas. An unhealthy political process is when ideas are used to battle people. The former leads to productivity, while the later leads to corruption. If you find yourself looking for data or ideas to battle people, take a step back. Computer *aided* governance requires a data driven decision making process. If your emotions are in the drivers seat you're not doing it right.

## Concepts

### Look For Data

Is the motivation and rationale for a proposal backed by data? If not, can you find any data that supports or refutes a proposal?

### Informed Opinions

Think about and internalize questions enough to be able to argue for and against competing viewpoints. This can help greatly speed up debates by reducing time wasted on obvious answers. It can also make things more productive as the ideas that are surfaced are likely to be more interesting and insightful if some real thought is put into them.

### Don't Take Things Personally.

Or at least try not to. This is easier said than done. Once you've mastered this you've mastered life.

### Understand Context

Think about the broader context of the discussion to ensure that the full picture is brought into view, not just a curated slice that supports a particular narrative.

### Know Your Audience

Most people don't comment, but they might read and vote. In responses to comments you're speaking to the broader community as well as the direct recipient of question/response.

## Tools

### Use Socratic questioning to check your assumptions.

[Socratic Questioning](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/) can help you get a fresh perspective when you're getting too emotional or are just stuck in a rut.

- Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)
- Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?)
- Looking for evidence (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)
- Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
- Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)
- Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)

### Engage in good faith and give people the benefit of the doubt.

What would your response be if you thought they were the smartest person in the world?

What would your response be if you they were your best friend?

Are either of these responses potentially better than your current thinking?

### Make sure you're not hangry.

Really simple. Eat a snack. Take a nap. Try again in a few hours.
