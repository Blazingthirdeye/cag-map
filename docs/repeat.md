CAG MAP is a data driven political process. [The goal is to help stakeholders understand, improve, and maintain the systems they care about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQuuQvEDwkY).

In a pluralistic society there is no such thing as the indisputable public good. It's up to stakeholders to advocate for their interests. If interests are aligned things might work out, but if not your then road will be very difficult. Always seek to align interests.

Creating proposals that align interests requires critical thinking. Critical thinking requires being critical. CAG MAP can help you use a data driven process to write, analyze, and critique proposals. This isn't guaranteed to be great, but it is guaranteed to be better than just arguing. Good luck out there.
